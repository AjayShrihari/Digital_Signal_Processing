README:

Run dsp_final.m (contains source code of final project, with interactive filter design and window application on sinusoids. Done without inbuilt functions.)
n   : filter order (must be odd number)
fs  : sampling frequency used
fp  : cutoff frequency (lower cutoff frequency if bandpass filter is selected)
fp1 : upper cutoff frequency for bandpass filter 

Run dsp_windows.m (code for the project, done with inbuilt function fir1() )

Run dsp1.m (Function generated by inbuilt filter designer tool, of specifications given in the research paper attached)

dsp1.fda (contains the filter designed for dsp1.m)

Run dsp.slx (simulink model for dsp1.m, as implemented in research paper)

Run dsp2.m (testbench for filter object created in dsp1.fda)
